# d2-checklist Modernization Plan (v2)

Tracking document for the next round of incremental improvements. The previous plan (v1) covering TypeScript strictness, unit tests, parse.service.ts split, bundle budgets, CI/CD hardening, service provider standardization, and Angular 14→18 migration is fully complete.

**Current state (as of 2026-04-06):**
- Angular 19.2.20, TypeScript 5.8.3, RxJS 7.8.2
- 185 unit tests, 7/7 TypeScript strict flags, `strictTemplates` enabled, `no-explicit-any` warning (481 warnings)
- Standalone components (default in Angular 19), esbuild application builder, `bootstrapApplication()`
- `parse.service.ts` (~1800 lines) delegates to 4 domain-specific parsers, `parsePlayer` broken into 8 focused methods
- Bundle budgets enforced, CI runs tests + manifest fetch + bundle reporting

---

## Phase 1: Documentation & Git LFS Cleanup

Remove all stale git LFS references and broken LFS pointer files left over from the v1 migration.

- [x] Update `CLAUDE.md` — remove LFS section and references, update `src/assets/` description and `parse.service.ts` line count
- [x] Update `README.md` — fix Angular version (was 14, now 18), remove LFS references
- [x] Update `.gitignore` — remove 4 un-ignore lines for deleted LFS files
- [x] Update `package.json` `clean` script — remove exclusions for deleted files
- [x] Delete `.gitattributes` (empty, no longer needed)
- [x] Delete 4 unreferenced LFS pointer files (`destiny2-energytype.json`, `destiny2-equipmentslot.json`, `destiny2-pursuittags.json`, `destiny2-recordseasons.json`)
- [x] Delete unreferenced `panda-godrolls.json` (unminified; only `.min.json` is used at runtime)
- [x] Restore real JSON content for `panda-godrolls.min.json` and `fake-milestones.json` (were LFS pointers)
- [x] Untrack all `src/assets/*.json` from git LFS
- [ ] Bump version in `package.json`

**Done when:** `git grep -i "git lfs"` returns no matches. No LFS pointer files remain. `npm run build:prod` succeeds.

---

## Phase 2: Angular 19 Upgrade

Upgraded from Angular 18 to 19.

- [x] Fix 2 `UntypedFormControl` usages → typed `FormControl<string | null>`
- [x] `ng update @angular/core@19 @angular/cli@19` — all @angular/* to 19.2.x, TypeScript to 5.8.3, zone.js to 0.15.1
- [x] `ng update @angular/material@19` — Material and CDK to 19.2.x, styles.scss updated
- [x] Update `@angular-eslint/*` to 19.x
- [x] Upgrade `@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome` 0.15.0 → 1.0.0 (Angular 19 peer dep)
- [x] Removed `standalone: true` from 119 components (default in Angular 19)
- [x] Fixed template error in `history.component.html` (`this.player` → `player` for template variable)

**Done.** All 185 tests pass. 0 lint errors. Build succeeds.

---

## Phase 3: Break Up `parsePlayer` Method

The ~640-line `parsePlayer` method in `parse.service.ts` was the last major monolith.

Extracted 7 private methods (kept in same file):
- [x] `initializeMilestones()` — milestone parsing and sorting
- [x] `parseCharactersAndProgressions()` — character data, progressions, activities
- [x] `parseCurrencies()` — profile currency parsing
- [x] `parseGearAndInventory()` — inventory items across characters/vault/shared
- [x] `gatherPresentationData()` — collect nodes/records/collections from profile and characters
- [x] `parseCollections()` — collectibles and badge trees
- [x] `parseRecordsAndTriumphs()` — triumph hierarchy, seals, catalysts, lore
- [x] `finalizePlayerData()` — title, transitory data, currencies, light level, dynamic strings, return Player
- [x] Reduced `parsePlayer` to 83 lines of orchestration

**Done.** All 185 tests pass. `parsePlayer` is 83 lines.

---

## Phase 4: Eliminate `any` Types

446 ESLint `no-explicit-any` warnings. Top files: `parse.service.ts` (54), `tools/manifest/common.ts` (35), `milestone-parser.service.ts` (33), `gear-parser.service.ts` (31), `destiny-cache.service.ts` (25).

- [ ] Type the Bungie API response parameter (`resp`) in parse services with proper interfaces
- [ ] Type `tools/manifest/common.ts` cache interfaces (35 warnings, build-tooling only)
- [ ] Type `milestone-parser.service.ts` milestone responses (33 warnings)
- [ ] Type `gear-parser.service.ts` inventory item parsing (31 warnings, has test safety net)
- [ ] Type `destiny-cache.service.ts` cache lookups (25 warnings)
- [ ] Type remaining files: `triumph-parser.service.ts` (17), `vendor.service.ts` (16), `gear-filter-state.service.ts` (15), `shared/utilities.ts` (7), `storage.service.ts` (7)
- [ ] Escalate `no-explicit-any` from `warn` to `error` once under 50 remaining (with targeted `eslint-disable` for genuinely dynamic data)

Strategy: prefer `unknown` + type guards over `any` at API boundaries. Work in 3–5 PRs grouped by domain.

**Done when:** Under 100 warnings remaining. Top 5 files each have fewer than 10.

---

## Phase 5: Increase Test Coverage

Currently: 185 tests, ~13%/10%/15%/13% (statements/branches/functions/lines). Floor: 10/7/12/10.

Priority targets:
- [ ] Extracted `parsePlayer` sub-methods from Phase 3 (clear input/output contracts)
- [ ] `destiny-cache.service.ts` — cache loading and lookups
- [ ] `milestone-parser.service.ts` — milestone cooking logic
- [ ] `triumph-parser.service.ts` — seal/badge building
- [ ] `gear-filter-state.service.ts` — filter predicates
- [ ] Key components with significant logic (`GearComponent`, `PlayerComponent`)
- [ ] Raise coverage floor to 20/15/20/20

**Done when:** 300+ tests. Coverage floor at 20/15/20/20. Each `parsePlayer` sub-method has at least one test.

---

## Phase 6: Further Signal Adoption

274 `BehaviorSubject` instances across 52 files. Some already converted to signals.

Priority conversions:
- [ ] `gear-filter-state.service.ts` (45 BehaviorSubjects)
- [ ] `uber-list-state.service.ts` (28 BehaviorSubjects)
- [ ] `clan-state.service.ts` (18 BehaviorSubjects)
- [ ] Evaluate Angular 19 signal APIs (`resource()`, `linkedSignal()`) after Phase 2
- [ ] Convert incrementally, one service per PR

**Done when:** BehaviorSubject count under 150. The three largest files are converted.

---

## Execution Order

| # | Phase | Effort | Depends On |
|---|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | Documentation & Git LFS Cleanup | Small (1 PR) | — |
| 2 | Angular 19 Upgrade | Medium (1–2 PRs) | Phase 1 |
| 3 | Break Up parsePlayer | Medium (1 PR) | — |
| 4 | Eliminate `any` Types | Large (3–5 PRs) | Phase 3 |
| 5 | Increase Test Coverage | Large (3–5 PRs) | Phase 3 |
| 6 | Further Signal Adoption | Large (5+ PRs) | Phase 2 |

Phases 4 & 5 can run in parallel after Phase 3. Phase 6 can start after Phase 2.

## Notes

- Each phase should be its own PR (or set of PRs for large phases).
- ALWAYS bump `version` in `package.json` for each PR. If the bungie manifest version changes, also bump `"manifest"`.
- `console.log` calls are intentional — never remove them.
